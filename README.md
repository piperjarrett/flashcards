# FlashCards Solo Project

## Contributor

Piper Jarrett

## Abstract
In flashcards you will be able to answer a series of wuestions soley in the console. By running `node index.js` a question will show and give you three options of answers. Once you choose your answer it will display if it is correct or not. After all cards are answered the console will show the percent of correct questions you answered. 

## Working Application

## Technologies

* Javascript
* Git work Flow
* Chai 
* Mocha
* 
## Setup


## Where to Add Your Code

### JavaScript

**Create all of your feature code files in the `src` directory.**

We will be using the `module.exports` and `require` syntax to share code across files.

## How to View Your Code in Action

Once you are working through Iteration 3, you will want to start your server to test your functionality.
In the terminal, run:

```bash
node index.js
```

When the game is functioning appropriately, you will be prompted for each question, have the opportunity to select an answer, and will be given feedback. You will be able to play through the entire deck of cards:

## Test Files Organization

Similar to feature code, your test code needs to be put in a specific place for it to run successfully.

**Put all of your test files in the `test` directory.** As a convention, all test filenames should end with `-test.js`. For instance: `Round-test.js`.

## Running Your Tests

Run your test suite using the command:

```bash
npm test
```

The test results will output to the terminal.
